# Mechanisms_bot
Scientists often use the phrase, "the mechanisms by which X occur are not understood." I wrote a [Twitter bot](twitter.com/mechanisms_bot) in python using tweepy to query PubMed daily, and find abstracts using that syntax. Then it tweets one abstract per day. Runs on an AWS instance. I wrote a [short blog post](http://www.trailofpapers.net/2016/01/introducing-mechanisms-twitter-bot.html) about analytics of the mechanisms phraseology.

For example usage of code, see [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/map222/Mechanisms_bot/blob/master/notebooks/Mechanisms%20by%20which%20notebook.ipynb).
